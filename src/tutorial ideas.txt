*(1)Basic one
*(2)add more information in database and if no match in database, just reply "I don't know"
*(3)change all letters into capital ones and remove extra space and all the punctuations.
remember last response for a question and give a new response for the same question
*(4) match in a different way(similarity£ºLevenshtein Distance). If user keep saying the same thing, it should response something to complain
*(5) use class. need more information in database. when pressing enter without input, say something. check repeatition of bot's response from user.
*(6) startup conversation
*(7) keyword ranking: choose the keyword with higher similarity
*(8) Equivalent keywords: several keywords have the same responses
*(9) Keyword transposition and template response (no other appropriate keyword can be matched)
*(10) Keyword location concept using some extra sign in keywords

(11) Considering Context
*(12) Using Text To Speech
//(13) use database to store keyword
*(14) randomly select response to decrease repetition
(15) store the user's input in a file each time the chatbot was not able to find any matching keyword for the current input (use them to update our database of keyword and responses)
(16) saving the convers+ation logs to check weakness of our chatbot
(17) whenever the chatbot encounters an input that has no corresponding keyword, it would prompt the user about it

Algorithm:
NO KEYWORD WAS FOUND FOR THIS INPUT, PLEASE ENTER A KEYWORD
SO THE KEYWORD IS: (key)
(if response is no)PLEASE REENTER THE KEYWORD (go back to step #2)
NO RESPONSE WAS FOUND FOR THIS KEYWORD: (key) , PLEASE ENTER A RESPONSE
SO, THE RESPONSE IS: (resp)
(if response is no) PLEASE REENTER THE RESPONSE (go back to step #4)
KEYWORD AND RESPONSE LEARNED SUCCESSFULLY
IS THERE ANY OTHER KEYWORD THAT I SHOULD LEARN
(if response is yes, otherwise continue chating): PLEASE ENTER THE KEYWORD (go back to step #2)
